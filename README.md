# Bayesian Networks and SEM Analysis Project

This repository contains code and resources for statistical analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Bayesian Networks, focused on Positive Youth Development.

## Description

The code in this repository uses R to implement and visualize structural equation models and Bayesian networks. These models are designed to investigate relationships among various psychometric variables and demonstrate how these relationships can be modeled and understood through advanced statistical techniques.

## Repository Structure

- `R_*.R`: R scripts for specific analyses.
- `SANKEY*.png`, `SEM_*.png`: Images generated by the scripts that represent the graphical models.
- `app.R`, `app_shy.R`: Shiny applications for interactive model visualization.

## How to Use

To use this code, you will need R and possibly RStudio installed on your computer. Clone this repository using Git with the following command:
